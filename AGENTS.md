# AGENTS.md - Rules for AI Agents

## Golden Rules
1. **Never write code without a Task ID**
2. **Never change features without updating the spec**
3. **Always follow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement**

## Workflow
1. First, create Constitution (project principles)
2. Then, write Spec (WHAT to build)
3. Then, write Plan (HOW to build)
4. Then, write Tasks (detailed steps)
5. Finally, Implement (write code)

## Files You Must Follow
- `constitution.md` = Project principles
- `spec.md` = What to build
- `plan.md` = How to build it
- `tasks.md` = Step-by-step tasks

**If something is unclear, ASK. Don't guess.**
